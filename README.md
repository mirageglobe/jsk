## What is this repository for? ##

* Quick summary

This project has been shifted to be simply named *jimmys swiss-knife (JSK)*. JSK is a commandline application that does the following:

* converts common sound/music formats to be of mp3
* converts common video formats to be mp4 (not to be confused with mp4a which is mpeg 4 audio layer)
* converts common image formats to be optimised png (for the web/print)

The rational for this is that there are various tools that are fully equipped to do various fine grained optimisations however this comes as a cost for complexity. The key aim for this project is to have an all in one tool that can optimise all three of the filetypes and focus on one/two commmon outputs that is suffice for general use. The trade of is simplicity vs functionality coverage. This tool focuses on simplicity and core tooling.
